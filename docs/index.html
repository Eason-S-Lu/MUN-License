      The Model UN License (MUN License) is a comprehensive licensing framework specifically tailored for the regulation of content, materials, and resources associated with Model United Nations (MUN) conferences and related educational activities.<br>
      It has been crafted with the primary objective of promoting collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the protection of intellectual property rights, while also ensuring a stricter set of requirements for compatible licenses that govern the use of MUN-related materials.<br>
      Model United Nations conferences serve as platforms for students to engage in critical thinking, research, and diplomacy, simulating real-world international relations.<br>
      These conferences rely heavily on the use and distribution of various resources, including research papers, background guides, position papers, resolutions, and educational materials.<br>
      The MUN License aims to establish a transparent and equitable framework for the use and dissemination of these valuable resources while upholding the principles of intellectual property protection and responsible sharing.<br>
