    <p style="text-align:left">Preamble</p>
    <p> The Model UN License type NC (MUN-NC License) is a comprehensive licensing framework specifically drafted for the regulation and licensing of content, materials, and resources associated with Model United Nations (MUN) conferences and related educational activities. <br> It has been drafted with the primary objective of promoting collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the protection of intellectual property rights, while also ensuring a stricter set of requirements for compatible licenses that govern the use of MUN-related materials. <br> Model United Nations conferences serve as platforms for students to engage in critical thinking, research, and diplomacy, simulating real-world international relations. <br> These conferences rely heavily on the use and distribution of various resources, including research papers, background guides, position papers, resolutions, and educational materials. <br> The MUN-NC License aims to establish a transparent and equitable framework for the use and dissemination of these valuable resources while upholding the principles of intellectual property protection and responsible sharing. <br>
