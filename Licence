Preamble
The Model UN License (MUN License) is a comprehensive licensing framework specifically tailored for the regulation of content, materials, and resources associated with Model United Nations (MUN) conferences and related educational activities. It has been crafted with the primary objective of promoting collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the protection of intellectual property rights, while also ensuring a stricter set of requirements for compatible licenses that govern the use of MUN-related materials.

Model United Nations conferences serve as platforms for students to engage in critical thinking, research, and diplomacy, simulating real-world international relations. These conferences rely heavily on the use and distribution of various resources, including research papers, background guides, position papers, resolutions, and educational materials. The MUN License aims to establish a transparent and equitable framework for the use and dissemination of these valuable resources while upholding the principles of intellectual property protection and responsible sharing.
